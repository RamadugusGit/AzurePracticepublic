# MAGIC This notebook will show you how to create and query a table or DataFrame that you uploaded to DBFS. [DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html) is a Databricks File System that allows you to store data for querying inside of Databricks. This notebook assumes that you have a file already inside of DBFS that you would like to read from.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook is written in **Python** so the default cell type is Python. However, you can use different languages by using the `%LANGUAGE` syntax. Python, Scala, SQL, and R are all supported.

# COMMAND ----------

# File location and type
file_location = "/FileStore/tables/Uber.csv"
file_type = "csv"

# CSV options
infer_schema = "True"
first_row_is_header = "True"
delimiter = ","

# The applied options are for CSV files. For other file types, these will be ignored.
df = spark.read.format(file_type) \
  .option("inferSchema", infer_schema) \
  .option("header", first_row_is_header) \
  .option("sep", delimiter) \
  .load(file_location)

display(df)

# COMMAND ----------

df.printSchema()
from pyspark.sql.functions import dense_rank,desc
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
w0 = Window.partitionBy(df.date).orderBy(df.trips.desc())
df.withColumn('dense', dense_rank().over(w0)).show()
